# Paths

Kotlin JDSL has a Path interface to represent associations and fields between entities. Path interfaces can be created from Entities and can continue to be related, like method chaining.&#x20;

```kotlin
```

You can treat paths as expressions and put them in Select and Where clauses, and also use them to express associations between objects when joining.

```kotlin
```

Paths can also be cast to child classes via the Treat DSL function.

```kotlin
```
